# List of mdp files use in protein with ligand complex simulation

1. em.mdp
2. ions.mdp
3. nvt.mdp
4. npt.mdp
5. md.mdp

You need to apply changes in nvt.mdp, npt.mdp and md.mdp files at XXX = tc-grps = Protein_XXX Water_and_ion. XXX is your ligand name in *.gro file.
Also, you need to set the simulation time in md.mdp file
# nsteps = 100000000    ; 2 * 100000000 = 200000 ps (200 ns)
