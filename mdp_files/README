# List of mdp files use in simulation of protein in water only.

1. ions.mdp
2. minim.mdp
3. nvt.mdp
4. npt.mdp
5. md.mdp

You need to apply changes only in md.mdp for setting up the simulation time. I set for 200ns, you can adjust the time at fematosecond and picosecond.
# nsteps = 100000000  ; 2*100000000 = 200000 ps (200 ns)

#Errors
Mostly errors comes from ions.mdp, due to misarrange the number of total atoms in topol.top.
Open the topol.top file and goto last line set the format and save it.
